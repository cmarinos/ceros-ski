# Ceros Ski Code Challenge

Welcome to the Ceros Code Challenge - Ski Edition!

Under the Ceros Code Challege we create this repository to track down our progress and implement some of the features. The app has been deploy to a cloud provider and you can have fun with the updated version here: https://ceros-ski-cem.herokuapp.com/

The actions that took place in this version were the following:

Code commits:

* Fixed the bug with the left arrow.
* Added scores (player score, top scorer) and stored them to localStorage in order to have them after browser refreshes.
* Added a fixed dashboard in the top right corner for the scores and a live player's score while he plays.
* Added a favicon.

Devops actions:

* Create a new heroku app and connected with this repository. Also, automatic builds with the master branch were enabled.

Finally, issues for missing functionality, bugs and other changes are tracked down into the repository's issue tracker.


Thank you very much Ceros Team and looking forward for your contribution as well.
